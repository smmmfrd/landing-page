## About
My idea for this was to create a fan page for a terrible yugioh deck I enjoyed. Back when I played, I only used bad or low tier decks to their fullest potential. Wind ups were the first deck I invested money into because I loved their art and after they got nerfed into obscurity their pricing was next to nothing.
